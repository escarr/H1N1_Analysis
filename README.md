# H1N1_Analysis

This repository contains two main code files:

(1) Twitter_Data_Retrieval.ipynb - this file retrieves the tweets I used in my analysis. The tweets are also included in the github repository (one json file is included for each of the 8 times/milestones I analyzed).

(2) Data Exploration & Analysis.ipynb - this file performs all of my data exploration and analysis. To run it, it needs access to the json files containing the tweets and the H1N1_Data csv file (data used from https://www.ncbi.nlsm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3647645/). In addition to the analysis performed within the code file, a csv file, 'Final_Data.csv', is outputted that contains some of the data that may be useful for further analysis such as the most frequent words at each milestone, the topic words and the sentiment scores.
